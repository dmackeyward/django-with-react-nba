# A fun Django with React application to practice React fundamentals, Material UI styling, and API calls 

This application took around 1 week to make and gave me a lot of practice with React and Google's Material UI.
The main goal for this project was to implement an external API that I can process and modify it's data before passing it to a React frontend to render. I probably spent around 2 days working with the Django backend and the other 5 days was spent styling the application. 

In my GameModal component I have 3 useEffect calls which I feel might not be best practice, but nevertheless I really enjoyed solving the challenges that the GameModal had and the additional practice with useEffect was really beneficial for my overall learning.
